# Mybatis-x
This is a simple ORM framework between mybatis and jpa,complete ORM and semi-automatic assembly of SQL are provided.
For detailsï¼Œsee test case.
Domain-based database operations (separate tables) are currently available, and you can also assemble SQL statements freely in your code.Query API based on DSL style is under development
## Why did I create this project?
Queries based on mybtis and XML files are too complex. I don't want to write a lot of XML tags and the readability of XML is poor. It's foolish to encapsulate SQL statements in XML files by DSL, although some people think it can improve so-called "maintainability".
